Feature: As a student
	So that I can help other students avoid bad landlords
	I want to be able to review a landlord

Scanrio:
When I am on the Landlord page
 And I click "Review"
  And I fill in "Description" with "A few words."
   And I click "Submit Review"
Then I should be on the Landlord page
 But I should see "A few words."
